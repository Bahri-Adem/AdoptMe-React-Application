# AdoptMe-React-Application

Welcome to the AdoptMe Project! This project is designed to help you learn how to build real-world applications using modern React 18.x+. By following this course, you'll go beyond the basics and dive into using the latest features in React, including hooks, effects, context, and portals. Throughout the course, you'll also utilize tools from the entire React ecosystem, such as Vite, ESLint, TailwindCSS, React Router, and React Query. By the end of the project, you'll have built a complete application for browsing adoptable pets.

## Project Overview

- **JS Tools:** Gain an understanding of the commonly used tools and libraries in JavaScript development.
- **JSX:** Learn how to write JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React.
- **Hooks:** Explore the power of React hooks and their ability to simplify state management and side effects.
- **useEffect:** Understand the useEffect hook and how it enables you to perform side effects in React components.
- **Custom Hooks:** Discover how to create custom hooks to reuse logic across multiple components.
- **Component Composition:** Learn how to compose components to create more complex UI structures.
- **React Router:** Dive into React Router and learn how to handle routing and navigation in your application.
- **React Query:** Explore React Query, a powerful library for managing remote data in React applications.
- **Uncontrolled Forms:** Understand the concept of uncontrolled forms in React and how they differ from controlled forms.
- **Class Components:** Gain an understanding of class components, an older syntax for creating React components.
- **Error Boundaries:** Learn how to use error boundaries to handle and manage errors in React components.
- **Portals and Refs:** Explore portals and refs, two advanced features of React that allow you to work with the DOM outside of the component hierarchy.
- **Context:** Understand how to use context in React to share data between components without passing props explicitly.
